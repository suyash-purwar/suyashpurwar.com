## REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol — almost always HTTP.

### Key Principles

1. **Statelessness** — Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request
2. **Client-Server Architecture** — Separation of concerns between the UI and data storage
3. **Uniform Interface** — A consistent way to interact with resources
4. **Resource-Based** — Everything is a resource identified by URIs

### HTTP Methods

- `GET` — Retrieve a resource
- `POST` — Create a new resource
- `PUT` — Update/replace a resource
- `PATCH` — Partially update a resource
- `DELETE` — Remove a resource

### Status Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 | OK |
| 201 | Created |
| 400 | Bad Request |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |
