## Fact Data Modelling

### What are Facts?

Facts are the quantitative measurements of a business process. They are the numeric values that users want to analyze.

### Types of Fact Tables

1. **Transaction Facts** — One row per transaction event
2. **Periodic Snapshot Facts** — One row per time period
3. **Accumulating Snapshot Facts** — One row per entity lifecycle

### Grain

The grain defines what a single row in the fact table represents. Setting the grain correctly is critical:
- Too fine → excessive storage
- Too coarse → loss of analytical flexibility

### Measures

- **Additive** — Can be summed across all dimensions (e.g., revenue)
- **Semi-Additive** — Can be summed across some dimensions (e.g., account balance)
- **Non-Additive** — Cannot be summed (e.g., ratios, percentages)
