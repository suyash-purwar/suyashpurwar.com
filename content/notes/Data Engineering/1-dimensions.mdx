## Dimensional Modelling — Dimensions

### What are Dimensions?

Dimensions are the descriptive attributes that provide context to facts/measures. They answer the "who, what, where, when, why, and how" questions.

### Types of Dimensions

1. **Conformed Dimensions** — Shared across multiple fact tables
2. **Junk Dimensions** — Grouping of low-cardinality flags and indicators
3. **Degenerate Dimensions** — Dimension key with no associated dimension table (e.g., invoice number)
4. **Role-Playing Dimensions** — Same dimension used for different purposes (e.g., date dimension as order_date, ship_date)

### Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

- **Type 0** — Retain original value, never update
- **Type 1** — Overwrite old value with new value
- **Type 2** — Add new row with versioning (start_date, end_date, is_current)
- **Type 3** — Add new column for previous value
