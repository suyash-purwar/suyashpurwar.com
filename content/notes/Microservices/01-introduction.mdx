## Introduction to Microservices

Microservices is an architectural approach where an application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

### Characteristics

1. **Single Responsibility** — Each service does one thing well
2. **Independently Deployable** — Services can be updated without affecting others
3. **Decentralized Data** — Each service manages its own database
4. **Fault Isolation** — Failure in one service doesn't cascade
5. **Technology Agnostic** — Services can use different tech stacks

### Monolith vs Microservices

| Aspect | Monolith | Microservices |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Deployment | All-or-nothing | Independent |
| Scaling | Vertical | Horizontal |
| Complexity | Simple at first | Complex infrastructure |
| Team Structure | Single team | Multiple autonomous teams |

### Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous** — REST, gRPC
- **Asynchronous** — Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- **Event-Driven** — Event sourcing, CQRS
