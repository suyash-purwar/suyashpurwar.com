title: L4 and L7 Load Balancer
---

## Load Balancing: Layer 4 vs Layer 7

### Layer 4 (Transport Layer)

Operates at the TCP/UDP level. Makes routing decisions based on:
- Source/destination IP addresses
- Source/destination ports

**Pros:** Fast, low overhead, protocol-agnostic
**Cons:** No content-based routing, limited visibility

### Layer 7 (Application Layer)

Operates at the HTTP/HTTPS level. Can inspect:
- URL paths
- HTTP headers
- Cookies
- Request body

**Pros:** Content-based routing, SSL termination, caching
**Cons:** Higher latency, more resource-intensive

### Comparison

| Feature | L4 | L7 |
|---------|----|----|
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Routing | IP/Port based | Content based |
| SSL | Pass-through | Termination |
| Caching | No | Yes |
