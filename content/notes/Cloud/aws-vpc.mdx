## Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.

### Key Components

- **Subnets** — Range of IP addresses in your VPC
- **Route Tables** — Rules that determine where network traffic is directed
- **Internet Gateway** — Allows communication between your VPC and the internet
- **NAT Gateway** — Enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet
- **Security Groups** — Virtual firewall for your instances
- **Network ACLs** — Additional layer of security at the subnet level

### CIDR Blocks

VPCs use CIDR notation to define IP address ranges. For example:
- `10.0.0.0/16` gives you 65,536 IP addresses
- `10.0.1.0/24` gives you 256 IP addresses

### Best Practices

1. Use multiple Availability Zones for high availability
2. Use private subnets for backend services
3. Implement least-privilege security group rules
