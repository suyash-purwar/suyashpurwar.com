## Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Core Concepts

- **Pod** — Smallest deployable unit, contains one or more containers
- **Node** — A worker machine (physical or virtual) that runs pods
- **Cluster** — A set of nodes managed by the control plane
- **Service** — An abstract way to expose an application running on pods
- **Deployment** — Declarative updates for pods and replica sets

### Architecture

```
Control Plane
├── API Server (kube-apiserver)
├── Controller Manager
├── Scheduler
└── etcd (key-value store)

Worker Nodes
├── kubelet
├── kube-proxy
└── Container Runtime
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
