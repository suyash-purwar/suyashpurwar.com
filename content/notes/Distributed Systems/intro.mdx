## Distributed Systems Fundamentals

A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to users as a single coherent system.

### Key Challenges

1. **Network Partitions** — Communication failures between nodes
2. **Clock Synchronization** — No global clock across nodes
3. **Consensus** — Getting nodes to agree on a value
4. **Fault Tolerance** — System continues operating despite failures

### Consistency Models

- **Strong Consistency** — All reads return the most recent write
- **Eventual Consistency** — All replicas converge given enough time
- **Causal Consistency** — Preserves "happens-before" ordering

### Important Algorithms

- **Paxos** — Consensus protocol
- **Raft** — Simpler consensus protocol
- **Gossip Protocol** — Information dissemination
- **Consistent Hashing** — Distributed hash tables
