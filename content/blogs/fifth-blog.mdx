# 💸 Take Control of Your Future: Investing 101

Investing doesn't have to be complicated or scary. It's simply the act of putting your money to work to build wealth over time. Here is your roadmap to getting started.

## 1. The Foundation: Clear Debt and Build an Emergency Fund

Before you invest, ensure you have:
* A plan to pay off high-interest debt (like credit cards).
* 3 to 6 months of living expenses saved in an easily accessible savings account.

## 2. Stocks vs. Funds

* **Stocks:** Buying a small ownership share in a single company (e.g., Apple). Higher risk, potentially higher reward.
* **Mutual Funds / ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds):** Buying a basket of stocks or bonds. Lower risk due to immediate diversification. **Great for beginners!**

## 3. Where to Start Investing

1.  **Retirement Accounts (Best):** Max out tax-advantaged accounts first (e.g., 401k, Roth IRA).
2.  **Brokerage Account:** Open an account with a platform like Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard.
3.  **Invest in Low-Cost Index Funds:** Start with a fund that tracks a major index (like the S&P 500).

## 4. The Power of Compounding

Compounding interest is your best friend. The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow exponentially.
