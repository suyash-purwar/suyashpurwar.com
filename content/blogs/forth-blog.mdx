# ⚡ Speed Kills: Why Core Web Vitals are Essential for SEO

Google now considers Core Web Vitals (CWV) as official ranking factors. These three metrics focus on loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability—in short, the user experience.

## 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

LCP measures **loading performance**. It reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport.

> **Goal:** LCP should occur within **2.5 seconds** of the page starting to load.

## 2. First Input Delay (FID)

FID measures **interactivity**. It's the time from when a user first interacts with a page (e.g., clicks a button or link) to the time the browser is actually able to begin processing that event.

## 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

CLS measures **visual stability**. It quantifies how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—where elements jump around the page, causing misclicks.

## 4. Optimization Strategies

| Metric | Quick Fixes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **LCP** | Optimize images, implement lazy loading, upgrade hosting. |
| **FID** | Break up long tasks in JavaScript, use web workers. |
| **CLS** | Specify `width` and `height` attributes on all media elements. |
