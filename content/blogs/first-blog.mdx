# 🌑 Embracing the Shadows: The Case for Dark Mode

The sudden shift in default themes across every major operating system and application wasn't just a trend—it was a response to how we use screens today. Dark Mode has officially arrived.

## 1. The Science of Eye Strain

Studies suggest that high screen brightness against a light background (light mode) can contribute to digital eye strain. We look at:
* **Blue Light Exposure:** How dark mode can reduce the perceived intensity of blue light.
* **Pupil Size:** Why smaller pupils, often achieved in dark mode, can lead to sharper focus.

## 2. Real-World Benefits for Users

* **Battery Life:** Particularly on devices with **OLED/AMOLED screens**, where black pixels are truly off, dark mode can significantly conserve power. 
* **Improved Focus:** Many users report less distraction from peripheral vision when the background is muted.

## 3. How to Implement it on Your Website

For developers, offering a Dark Mode switch is easier than ever with modern CSS and Tailwind CSS.

### CSS Technique: `prefers-color-scheme`

```css
/* Light mode defaults */
body { background-color: white; color: black; }

/* Dark mode override */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body { background-color: #121212; color: #f0f0f0; }
}
